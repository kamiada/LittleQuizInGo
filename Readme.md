This quiz is an effect of following tutorial from calhoun.io on Go. 

In order to run Go first: 
``go build.``
build package (?) of your code will appear in the folder with the name of it. In my case that's Go_quizGame, because I love long names.

In order to run this package type in the consol: 
`` ./Go_quizGame -h``
